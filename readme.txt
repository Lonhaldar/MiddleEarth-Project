#######  PLEASE REPORT THE BUGS ! ########
This is an early beta, and obviously, you'll find some bugs. Please report them to us, either on our moddb page (http://www.moddb.com/mods/ck2-middle-earth-project), or on the Paradox Interactive Forum (http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?665444-Mod-Middle-Earth-Project)


#######  GAMEPLAY EXPLANATIONS  #######
-Plots are restricted for certain cultures, some of these restrictions end either when Sauron is destroyed via the ring quest, or if the year is 11390.
-Some units from certain cultures are very powerful, but there are fewer of them. Others, like orcs, are weaker but there are many more of them.
-Some events (such as when Mordor or Gondor is conquered and the nobles/provinces change cultures or are expelled MAY lead to a crash to desk-top if you're computer is a bit dated). The solution is to reload, play at speed 1, and let the event take its course, then you can speed up again.
-This is a late alpha/early beta. There may be some issues because of that - please report them in our mod forum, or on the main thread on the Paradox forums
-The mod is NOT fully tested for balance. We will need your feedback to get the mix right so it is challenging and fun for all sides.
-For more info check the in-game index via decision.
