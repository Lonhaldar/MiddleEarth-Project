Here's the new rep for our mod. I'll write here what we needs and what are the missions. 
Here's the list so far :
- GrandiSlayer : Buildings rework / Provinces work
- Moridin : Casus Belli
- Lonhaldar : Portraits / Cultures-Realms Colours in map / New Shadow events
- IratePirate- : Flavour events for Black Numenoreans
