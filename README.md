# MiddleEarth-Project

Here's the new rep for our mod. I'll write here what we needs and what are the missions. If you don't have work to do, just contact me and i'll give you some. So we'll be organized and won't work on the same things on our sides :)

DON'T MERGE YOUR FILES WITHOUT TESTING THEM, AND ALWAYS LOOK BEFORE IF THESE FILES WEREN'T CHANGED BEFORE YOU.

Here's the list so far :
- GrandiSlayer : Buildings rework / Provinces work
- Moridin : Casus Belli
- Lonhaldar : Portraits / Cultures-Realms Colours in map / New Shadow events
- IratePirate- : Flavour events for Black Numenoreans
